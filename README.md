## Purpose
This application provides Spotify users with a quick way to create clean versions of their playlists. Use cases: stores, restaurants, and people at social gatherings looking to play their music but are concerned on its family friendliness. This app opens up this opportunity by automating a process that would otherwise take too long to do manually.

## What is a "clean" version of a playlist?
Only the clean (non-explicit) versions of the tracks from the selected playlist are included in the "clean" playlist. If a clean version cannot be found for a particular track, it will be put into a "dirty" playlist for the user's convenience. The user will be able to easily decide what they want to do with the tracks in the "dirty" playlist.
